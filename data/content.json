    "text": "For me, everything started back in 2019, when I bought my first fraction of Bitcoin. In a matter of days I went down the rabbit hole. Carefully (and a bit scared) steering through hundreds of cryptocurrencies, I found the digital world of Decentralised Finance (DeFi). Seeing all the financial applications and services built on blockchain technology that operate without any intermediaries, was mind-blowing.\n\nThen followed a deep dive into the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where I witnessed the transition from the traditional Web 2.0 Business model to a Web 3.0 version. The technology was developing so quickly, that it was hard to keep up. This shift opened up business possibilities such as software development, finance, real estate, healthcare, etc. like never before. That’s when I realised I want to understand what was going on and one day be part of it.\n\nIn 2023, I attended a Python bootcamp where my first lines of code hit the terminal. I still wasn’t able to see the bigger picture, so I continued with a six month full-stack bootcamp, focused on both frontend (React.js) and backend (Django). Now, I get to be a part of the web/app-building process and I couldn’t be happier.\n\nHaving a professional background in healthcare taught me to counter-balance all the hours I spent in front of a screen. I manage this by being thrown around on the mats while learning the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and fit in regular gym workouts to keep me on point and structured.\n\nMotivated by a commitment to growth and progress, I’m focused on finding new avenues to advance my knowledge and avoid being just another \"average Joe\" developer."
